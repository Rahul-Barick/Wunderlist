# Wunderlist
Wunderlist enables you to add items to the list,manage tasks,subtasks,notes to tasks,edit to-do's,update to-do's,delete to-do's with the help of Rest api using Node js. My main aim to implement is to understand the development of server-side logic and maintenance of central database (here i have used MongoDB) , and ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end.Here i have used server-side templating language (EJS)
